# rock-paper-scissors

This is my attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. You can play a game of Rock Paper Scissors in the console against the computer. After 5 rounds, a winner is declared.

This project displays the skills I've developed in JavaScript, demonstrating the use of variables, functions, and conditionals to build the mechanics of the game.
